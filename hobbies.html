    <h1>My Hobbies and Joys</h1>
        <p>Hi I'm Loghan, I'm a student at <a herf="https://cart.org/">CART</a>. I have done many sports that has effected me in different ways, 
and hobbies that made me more productive. So here are my Hobbies and Joys, i hope you can relate.</p>
    <h2>Sports</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Mauy Thai</p></li>
                <li><p>Fencing</p></li>
                <li><p>Football</p></li>
                <li><p>Soccer</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Mauy Thai is my favorite Sport or hobbie I have done. It's also the sport I am cernantly practicing.
                Its a type of Martial arts, that uses fists, knees, kicks, and elbos. It is sometimes refeered to the 8 limb sport.

                Fencing... It was something. It was expensive, boring, and useless. In order to actaully learn how to fence
                I needed to pay some guy lots of money. The worst part in my opionon is how useless it was. When I am ever going to
                fight someone with a sword like that? Never. I only spent a few months before taking a break from sports.

            <p>
                Football, is another sport that I love. I enjoyeed playing it, but I am a small kid on the line. I couldn't catch or 
                throw so they put me on the line. But I did do very well as a defensive end, where I got bumped up to A team and 
                won an award. Sadly it didn't last I was okay on the line during Middle School, after 3 years I stopped, but now I am 
                huge into football.

            <p>
                Soccer, was boring. Didn't like it at all, all I did was sit on the bench. I was not good though so it wasn't suprising.
                I played for 6 years then did football, but after football I decisided to try out soccer again. It didn't go great instead
                of me being benched because i was bad this time it was beacuse I would takle people, but that was fun.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Watching Football</li>
                <li><p>Playing D&D</li>
                <li><p>Playing Fantasy</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Ever since I played football, I got really into watching the sport. I don't remeber why I <em>love</em> 
                <strong>San Fransico 49ers.</strong> Whenever they are playing I will stop everything and watch them. 
                The frist few years were, not to great. The 49ers were last in the NFL, but now they are #1, so its so much more enjoable. Defently my favorite hobby.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I started D&d like 9 years ago. Very fun game, just wish I could do it more. If you don't know what it is then allow me to 
                explain. It is a 'roleplay' game where you control a character of your chosen and like any video game you level up by doing
                different tasks, but the catch is that it's a board game, and there is a DM who controls the game and levels you up. So the
                DM is the god basicaly or the game master.

                Fantasy is an game where you pick different football players and make your own team to go againest other teams. It's fun, haven't
                won a playoffs yet. I do think I have a chance this year though. I have been playing for 4 years and only made it to the playoffs 
                twice, so I got 50%-%50 odds of making it to the playoffs. It's a lot of fun.
